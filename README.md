  - Timetable? – calendar system?

# The WHY in this project

**Problem:**

There is a serious number of I.N. kids that are too high-functioning to be in a special-needs school yet learn at completely different/ often a far slower pace than standard school curriculums. While there are efforts to cater for these kids there remain many issues.

- **Their schoolwork is not catered properly for them.**
  - Due to no real modified curriculum existing.
  - Due to a lack of proper recording/ progress tracking of their work.
  - Lack of communication between E.S. staff and teachers. (No platform dedicated to this).
- **Their records are often inaccurate**
  - I.N. kids need to be more closely monitored
  - Their schoolwork/ progress doesn't fit the models of regular school data systems.

**Solution:**

- Create a school administrative/data ecosystem that is separate/ works as an extension of 'compass'.
  - Makes it easy and clear to track progress of I.N. kids.
  - Links to curriculum/content designed for them.
  - Provides a clear description of what level a kid is at in their ability for diff subjects.
  - Works to connect teachers/ E.S. staff… so that there is no miscommunication about the needs of a kid. (Noticeboards/showpage comments)

**Closer look into the issue…**

This project aims to create an app that works like 'compass' in school systems but is solely for individual needs kids. Currently, their student data is tracked on the regular 'compass' system which most schools use for all their students.

Students with learning difficulties due to disabilities and disorders require additional needs whilst at school. **This means that their grading/testing systems are different, their development/growth can ebb and flow, and the content/curriculum they are exposed to is often modified…**

To assure that these students are able to reach their potential it is vital that they are monitored properly, and that teachers/ES staff understand where the student is at. It becomes problematic when their records start getting clumped and forced into structures/data system that wasn't made specifically for the

**Often it is difficult to track the progress and keep records of how kids with additional needs have been performing and at exactly what ability level they are at.**

Unfortunately **, there doesn't exist a separate system that tracks how they have been going and what they need to be doing.** As a result of this, exactly what a certain kid is capable of is unclear and areas where they need to improve are left ambiguous and up to the discretion of classroom support staff who often play an awkward messenger role between the student's teachers and education support team.

There needs to be one administrative hub that teachers and education support staff can access solely for kids with disability and additional needs.

This needs to be more than just a record of data, tracking – it needs to have a student login which will include everything the kid has done and needs to do. There are many benefits to this as it will keep goals within the reach of these students, allow them to feel a sense of progress and achievement as they will have visual rewards/bars of completion.

For example, it is often the case that a student with autism and lower cognitive ability will be doing grade 1-2 math tasks of Mathletics in year 9 whilst their friends' complete algebra. Not only does this hold a level of embarrassment/shame for the kid but it is not specifically catered for kids with individual needs. Since there are no equivalents of Mathletics for English/Science for example, the content of these subjects is often modified on the whim, teacher's kind of guess and hope that it will suit the student – Often… they are given a standard 'modified' test or task that ALL I.N. kids are given, despite them all being at vastly different ability levels. The student login area subject show-pages needs to link to a separate suitable curriculum with clearly outlined tasks.
